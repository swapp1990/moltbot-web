# Moltbot Web — Roadmap (public demo)

Last updated: 2026-01-28 (UTC)

## Next (high-signal, small)
1. **Remove personal naming from the public demo**
   - Observed: header says **“Good morning, Swap”** on the public site.
   - Change: default to a generic greeting (e.g., “Good morning”) and allow optional local-only name in settings.

2. **Make mobile scanning easier with collapsible sections**
   - Observed: on mobile, the page is very long (Money → Calendar → Projects) and requires lots of scrolling.
   - Change: add a simple accordion / collapse toggle per section; remember state locally.

3. **Clarify Import/Export + local-storage privacy in one place**
   - Observed: About banner explains privacy, but Import/Export still feels “power-user” without guidance.
   - Change: add a 1–2 line helper under Import/Export: “Import a JSON backup to restore this browser; export to back up/share sample data.”

## Soon
4. **Add “Today’s focus” presets tied to goals**
   - Add quick-pick chips like: “Debt payoff sprint”, “Raise monthly income”, “Travel prep”, “Ship feature”.
   - Keep local-only; no real financial data.

5. **Public “What I’m building” block (non-sensitive)**
   - Expand Projects section: 1 short paragraph on how these projects relate to income growth + automation.

## Later
6. **Accessibility + semantics pass** (labels, contrast checks, keyboard)
7. **Lightweight analytics (privacy-preserving)** (optional)
