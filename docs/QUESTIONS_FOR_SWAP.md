# Questions for Swap (Moltbot Web)

## 2026-01-29 (UTC)
1. **Public demo greeting:** should the default be just “Good morning” (no name), or “Good morning, friend”?
2. **Header UX:** on mobile, do you want Import/Export as (a) two stacked buttons, or (b) a single “Data” button that opens a small menu?
3. **Build/deploy line:** keep it visible (smaller footer), hide behind a toggle, or remove entirely from prod?
4. **Projects showcase:** confirm the exact list of repos to show publicly (and any to exclude).
5. **Loading experience:** on slow connections, do you prefer seeing a persistent “Loading Moltbot…” placeholder until the dashboard appears (recommended), or hide it ASAP even if there’s a brief blank screen?
6. **Projects card link visibility:** should “View on GitHub →” be always visible on desktop, or only on hover (current behavior)?
