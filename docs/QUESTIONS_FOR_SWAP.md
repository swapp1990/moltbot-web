1. **Public demo greeting:** should the default be just “Good morning” (no name), or “Good morning, friend”?
2. **Projects section copy:** do you want the descriptions to be more *product/benefit* (income growth / automation) or more *technical*?
3. **Mobile UX:** would you prefer an accordion (collapse sections) or a bottom nav (Money / Calendar / Projects)?
